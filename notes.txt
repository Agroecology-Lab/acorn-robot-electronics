TODO RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER PRODUCTION

Make clear the polarity for U5 、D19、D5、D6、D20、D7、D21、D18

e-stop should activate if a cable is disconnected. - nevermind, it does this

make CAN controller crystal value more clear - 16mhz not 12mhz!

invert CAN TX/RX LED polarity either by using inverting buffer part number or by rewiring input - maybe inverted is best for fast cut-off?
