motherboard:
	fix size of C5, 8mm diameter too small
	USB diode doesn't work, I guess need ideal diode to handle more power? LTC4412 controller and p-ch mosfet. need reverse current protection mostly

	fork board, flip camera connectors. delete camera connectors from main board
	add camera LED control
	add something to the design to hold CM4 in reset until power is stabilized? why does it not always boot at power on?
	are any switches backwards?
	add ground test points
	check the size of the PTH holes used on the DC DC converter
	consider a power on delay chip attached to GLOBAL_EN, or debug inconsistent power on condition. or is that due to incorrectly seated CM4?
	
odrive aux board:
	footprint for buffers is wrong, copy from motherboard
