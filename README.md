### About

PCBs designed in Kicad for Acorn the farming robot.

Our dream is that you will fab your own boards, make changes, and share your work - giving this design life beyond our efforts.

Designed by Taylor Alexander for Twisted Fields, for the Acorn Precision Farming Rover.

Many thanks to [Daniel Theobald](https://www.twistedfields.com/blog). Without your financial support and encouragement this project would not have been possible.
